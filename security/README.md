# Docker Network Modes

* The Docker networking mode to use for the containers in the task. The valid values are `none, bridge, awsvpc, and host`. 
* The default Docker network mode is `bridge`. If using the Fargate launch type, the `awsvpc` network mode is required. If using the EC2 launch type, any network mode can be used.
* The `host` and `awsvpc` network modes offer **the highest networking performance** for containers because they use the Amazon EC2 network stack.
