* The Alexa services are specific to the Alexa platform. You can create skills but they can only be invoked via an Alexa client (eg Amazon Echo).

* Amazon Lex and Amazon Polly give you the building-blocks to create your own voice-based service and do not require integration with the Alexa Voice Services platform.
